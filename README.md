My name is Vitor Hugo, you can call me Hazell too!

I believe it is never too late to start over or completely change the course of life in order to achieve dreams!

So here begins my new life story!

Passionate about games, technology and now entering the programming business! 
I am constantly in search of knowledge and challenges, programming and technology are part of my life, and I hope here to start the dream of living on that.

Currently graduating in Information Systems and learning JavaScript
